## What is OOP?

> "Object-oriented programming is more than just classes and objects;
> it's a whole programming paradigm based around objects (data structures)
> that contain data fields and methods. It is essential to understand this;
> using classes to organize a bunch of unrelated methods together is not
> object orientation.
>  --- Junade Ali, Mastering PHP Design Patterns
